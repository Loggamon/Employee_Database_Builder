# Employee Database Builder  
## Description

Why did you decide to build this project?

````
For this project, our task is to create a program that allows the user to create a database for their company.

This database will hold a list of departments in the company, a list of all employess, and a list of job roles. All together, when a query is inputted, the user will be able to see the relations between the three tables in the database.
Rather than hard-coding all the data, the user will be able to add the data via a questionnaire!

## Installation

How to install:

````
- To install this program, you will need to clone this repo to your local machine!
- The next step is to install all of the dependencies; to do this, open up the terminal (the origin should be where the parent folder for the project) and type "npm i". This will install inquirer, express, mysql2, sequelize, and dotenv.
- Now, we need to set up your database connection. Located in the folder is a file called .env.EXAMPLE; this will contain a name value (where youll put your mySQL username), a database value (this can stay as it is), and a password value (where you'll put your mySQL password). Change these values, and then change the name of the file to ".env".
	- NOTE! Make sure you have mySQL downloaded and set up on your local machine! this will be the backbone of the program!
- Finally, you'll have to run you schema and seeds files! In the terminal (the origin should be where the parent folder for the project is), log in to mysql and type "source db/schema.sql" and "source db/seeds.sql" respectively. Exit out of mySQL, and start the program by typing "node server".


- Congrats! you're ready to start coding!
